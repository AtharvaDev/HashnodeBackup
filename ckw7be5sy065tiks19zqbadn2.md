Description
Learn to code from the ground-up by building a fully functional social network with real-time capabilities.

Sounds crazy right! But it’s not beyond what you can do these days! and this course will guide you step-by-step through the process.

This course is made for absolute beginners. No prior programming knowledge is required to take this course. The main goal of the course is to give you a quick exposure to the full development stack, using JavaScript, as opposed to the usual approach of learning one thing at a time and never getting a “big picture” view.

These are the exciting topics we teach in the course:

HTML
CSS
Responsive web design
JavaScript
DOM access and manipulation
Meteor to build web applications
MongoDB to store and query your data
The course follows a project-based approach. Concepts are introduce as we need them to build our social network project. We strongly believe this is the best approach for people who are starting web development and want a quick look at the entire process, instead of covering each topic in depth right away.

Pablo Farias Navarro is a software developer and founder of ZENVA. Pablo has been programming since 1996 and has taught programming to over 100k students. By following our usual project-based approach, by the end of this course you’ll have the skills to create solid web applications.
