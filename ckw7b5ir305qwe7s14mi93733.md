â€“ Coding examples

To learn programming it is not enough just watching videos and reading books. You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.


â€“ Open source code

We hide nothing from our students! Including the source code for the hometask solutions and source code of examples which were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.

You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure environment and make tests work, especially in case student didnâ€™t work with any testing framework in the past.

â€“ Q&A support 

The significant difference between online and offline learning process is instructorâ€™s availability. If you are in the one room with tutor he always can help you to get understanding specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer.
In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in Q&A section. In case there will be recurring questions â€“ separate video lessons will be created to show how to address issue.

So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh? ðŸ™‚ ) , but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course.

â€“ Relevant knowledge

After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them has nothing in common with real life. Information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, instructor teaches framework which is not used already for 15 years. Or instructor do a stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!

Instructor of this course is consultant in the top-rated IT outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check LinkedIn page of instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people acrooss all over the world (BTW most of them are from top 100 companies of the world) evaluated skills of Andrii Piatakha.
